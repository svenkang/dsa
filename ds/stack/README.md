# Stack

First In Last Out (FILO)

## Performance of a stack
    - very fast O(1) for all operations

## Advantages of stack
    - simple
    - useful for FILO
    - useful for reversing (back-tracking, reversing)

## Disadvantages of stack
    - limitation on how to access data

## Specification
    - Len(): returns the current size of stack
    - Peak(): returns the current top element of the stack
    - Push(): adds an element to the top of the stack
    - Pop(): removes and returns the top of the stack
    - Peek(): views the top element of the stack without popping
